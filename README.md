# Introduction

Hi, I'm Saif! I made this repository after looking at the course outline for Mike Mirzayanov's course for
***Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms***, which can be seen here,

> https://in.harbour.space/data-science/advanced-algorithms-and-data-structures-mikhail-mirzayanov/

I'm basically learning Speed Programming, and wanted to implement all of the things mentioned in the
outline, so here's my repo containing just that.

### Can I use this?

It's MIT license, use it wherever you feel like it.

### Report bugs, please

Send me a pull request, open up an issue, or mail me at *saifulislam84210@gmail.com*, or at *su.islam404@gmail.com*
regarding any issues that you have.

### Want me to implement some Algorithm or Data Structure?

Send me an email at the above mentioned gmail accounts ; I would love to, it would help you reuse bug-free code, and
help me to learn those things at my own pace as well.
